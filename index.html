    <b style = "font-size:30px">Simulating Tennis Matches</b> <br>
    Over the past couple of months, I have completed a project that developed and evaluated a method for predicting tennis match results using match simulation. This project 
    brings together some different things I've worked on in the past along with my first attempt at simulation using maximum likelihood estimation. In order to predict matches, the method uses
    a post-match win probability model to estimate win probability for simulations of tennis matches drawn from match statistic distributions for each individual player. Further details on the implementation 
    and methodology can be found in the article <a href = "https://medium.com/@noahswan19/simulating-tennis-matches-with-maximum-likelihood-estimation-6e4c0ca1370e">
        here</a> and the code is posted on my GitHub.

    <b style = "font-size:30px">Predicting Pass Play Results for Professional Football</b> <br>
    For a Deep Learning class, I worked with two classmates to build a model to predict EPA and yards gained for NFL plays from the 2018 season. We wanted
    to see if we could build a model to predict the result of a pass play from conditions up to the throw. This model would allow 
    us to attribute credit to quarterbacks or wide receivers who consistently achieve higher EPA after the throw when compared to the model's predictions.
    We compared results for a random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network architecture, with the last performing the best.

    <b style = "font-size:30px">Predicting Balls Hit into Play </b> <br>
    As part of a Data Mining class, I worked with two classmates on a semester-long project to find a dataset and build a 
        model. Our group attempted to build a model classifying whether a ball hit into a play resulted in a hit or an out using data
        from the 2021 MLB season. We compared several types of models in the analysis and also implemented the SMOTE method for dealing
        with a class imbalance. The full details can be found in our final report <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/11rK3GrwBhMtU85GUOVqmGc7ICq-a2NWU/preview">

    <b style = "font-size:30px">Senior Economics Thesis </b> <br>
    During my senior year, I completed a year-long thesis on
    uncertainty within macroeconomics (final product <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iTR5CwXXeHizPxy0jonOBXAuq-LKp4Pw/preview">here</a>).
        Inspired by different papers applying the work of Thomas Kuhn to the field of economics, I attempted to
        contextualize the development of uncertainty within a Kuhnian, paradigmatic framework. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to pursue independent research on a topic of interest.

    <b style = "font-size:30px">Designing a Gameplan for the Golden State Warriors</b> <br>
    As part of the executive board of the Sports Analytics Club at Villanova University, I helped lead a team in designing 
    <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/17fEVV0RaFbizc98_aBXm5AhDykG-EgnH/preview">this presentation</a>
     that ultimately won the 2023 Syracuse Basketball Analytics competition. We were tasked with building a gameplan to 
    defend the Golden State Warriors using play-by-play and possession data. We analyzed team and player tendencies, 
    using points per possession as a measure of efficiency. We also modeled points over expectation using an XGBoost model to
    identify areas of the court where the Warriors outperformed the average. I was in charge of the model building along with 
    the visualizations, and the team gave the presentation to a panel of judges who deemed ours the best ahead of finalists
    from Tulane, Penn, and Duke.

    <b style = "font-size:30px">"The Most Confusing Players in Tennis"</b> <br>
    I was inspired to write this article after listening to a podcast episode trying to identify the hardest players to
    analyze on the ATP tour. My approach to this question was to try and identify the least consistent players on tour as a proxy
    for being difficult to analyze. My initial strategy was to look at match-to-match variance
    in player statistics. I also built a couple of models predicting match statistics using lagged player statistics to see which
    players were consistently the hardest to predict. All results and further discussion can be found in the article 
     <a href = "https://medium.com/@noahswan19/atp-confounding-all-stars-ba5ce15f4e5a">here</a> and the code for the article can be

    <b style = "font-size:30px">Modeling Expected Points in Python</b> <br>
    I have mainly worked in R up until recently, so this is my first project doing data work in Python outside of some 
    spot work in a Deep Learning class. As an R programmer, you will notice most of the code 
    (<a href = "https://github.com/noahswan19/Misc-Projects/blob/main/Clean%20EP%20Model%20(2024.03.29%20NS).ipynb">here</a>) 
    takes advantage of method chaining in pandas at least for the data cleaning.
    For the project, I built an XGBoost model to predict the points scored on a drive
    given the circumstances in a play. This methodology underlies the EPA statistic oft-cited in NFL analytics circles. I compare
    my results to those included in the play-by-play data in the nfl_data_py python package.

    During my role as lead data analyst at Oklahoma City Energy, I built out several shiny apps for the coaching staff which I 
  wanted to share here. Apologies for any delays in accessing the apps; my code has improved since writing these apps. Despite some inefficiencies, I think the following apps have some interesting visuals.

      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassMaps/">Pass Maps and xT</a> - This was the main app
      we used while I was working there with a variety of different graphs and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassNetworksApp/">Pass Networks</a> - This app hosted one computationally intensive graphic
        to create and was offloaded to a separate app.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/Recruitment/">Recruitment App</a> - This was the main recruitment app that included visualizations
      related to the relative performances of players across different positions and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://nswan.shinyapps.io/KPI_App/">KPIs</a> - This app provided a more concise visual to track how the team performed
      across different statistics throughout the season.</li>
