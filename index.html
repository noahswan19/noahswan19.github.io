<!--   Shiny Apps -->

  <p style = "font-size:20px;padding-left: 45px;
  padding-right: 45px;">
    During my role as lead data scientist at Oklahoma City Energy, I built out several shiny apps for the coaching staff which I 
  wanted to share here. Apologies for any delays in accessing the apps; my code has improved since writing these apps initially but 
  they remain a relic of a couple of years ago. Despite some inefficiencies, I think the following apps have some interesting visuals.
    <ul style = "font-size:20px;padding-left: 65px;
  padding-right: 65px;">
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassMaps/">Pass Maps and xT</a> - This was the main app
      we used while I was working there with a variety of different graphs and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassNetworksApp/">Pass Networks</a> - This app hosted one 
      graphic that was computationally intensive (for my code at the time) to create and was offloaded to a separate app.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/Recruitment/">Recruitment App</a> - This was the main recruitment app that included visualizations
      related to the relative performances of players across different positions and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://nswan.shinyapps.io/KPI_App/">KPIs</a> - This app provided a more concise visual to track how the team performed
      across different statistics over the course of the season.</li>

        Predicting Pass Play Results for Professional Football</a> - 
        For my Deep Learning class, I worked with two classmates to build a model to predict EPA and yards gained for NFL plays from the 2018 season. We wanted
        to see if we could build a model that predicted the result of a pass play from conditions up to the throw. This model would allow 
        us to attribute credit to quarterbacks or wide receivers who consistently achieve higher EPA after the throw when compared to the model's predictions.
        We compared results for a random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network architecture with the last of the three performing the best.
        The full report can be found in the link.

        Predicting Balls Hit into Play 
        </a>
         - As part of my Data Mining class, I worked with two classmates on a semester-long project to find a dataset and build a 
        model. Our group attempted to build a model classifying whether a ball hit into a play resulted in a hit or an out using data
        from the 2021 MLB season. We compared several types of models in the analysis and also implemented the SMOTE method for dealing
        with a class imbalance. The full details can be found in our final report in the link.

          Senior Economics Thesis
        </a> - During my senior year, I completed a year-long thesis writing about the subject of uncertainty within macroeconomics.
        The thesis was inspired by different works I had read applying the work of Thomas Kuhn to the field of economics, so my thesis attempts
        to contextualize the development of uncertainty within the idea of paradigms. The final thesis ended up leaning more into philosophy than
        into any data work, but I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to pursue independent research in a topic of interest.
