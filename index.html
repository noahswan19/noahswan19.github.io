    During my role as lead data scientist at Oklahoma City Energy, I built out several shiny apps for the coaching staff which I 
  wanted to share here. Apologies for any delays in accessing the apps; my code has improved since writing these apps initially but 
  they remain a relic of a couple of years ago. Despite some inefficiencies, I think the following apps have some interesting visuals.
    <ul style = "font-size:20px;padding-left: 65px;
  padding-right: 65px;">
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassMaps/">Pass Maps and xT</a> - This was the main app
      we used while I was working there with a variety of different graphs and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassNetworksApp/">Pass Networks</a> - This app hosted one 
      graphic that was computationally intensive (for my code at the time) to create and was offloaded to a separate app.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/Recruitment/">Recruitment App</a> - This was the main recruitment app that included visualizations
      related to the relative performances of players across different positions and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://nswan.shinyapps.io/KPI_App/">KPIs</a> - This app provided a more concise visual to track how the team performed
      across different statistics over the course of the season.</li>

    <b style = "font-size:30px">Predicting Pass Play Results for Professional Football</b> <br>
    For my Deep Learning class, I worked with two classmates to build a model to predict EPA and yards gained for NFL plays from the 2018 season. We wanted
    to see if we could build a model that predicted the result of a pass play from conditions up to the throw. This model would allow 
    us to attribute credit to quarterbacks or wide receivers who consistently achieve higher EPA after the throw when compared to the model's predictions.
    We compared results for a random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network architecture with the last of the three performing the best.

<!-- Data Mining Project -->

    padding:1em">
    <b style = "font-size:30px">Predicting Balls Hit into Play </b> <br>
    As part of my Data Mining class, I worked with two classmates on a semester-long project to find a dataset and build a 
        model. Our group attempted to build a model classifying whether a ball hit into a play resulted in a hit or an out using data
        from the 2021 MLB season. We compared several types of models in the analysis and also implemented the SMOTE method for dealing
        with a class imbalance. The full details can be found in our final report <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/11rK3GrwBhMtU85GUOVqmGc7ICq-a2NWU/preview">

<!-- Senior Thesis -->

    padding:1em">
    <b style = "font-size:30px">Senior Economics Thesis </b> <br>
    During my senior year, I completed a year-long thesis writing (final product <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iTR5CwXXeHizPxy0jonOBXAuq-LKp4Pw/preview">here</a>) 
    about the subject of uncertainty within macroeconomics.
        The thesis was inspired by different works I had read applying the work of Thomas Kuhn to the field of economics, so my thesis attempts
        to contextualize the development of uncertainty within the idea of paradigms. The final thesis ended up leaning more into philosophy than
        into any data work, but I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to pursue independent research in a topic of interest.

<!--   Syracuse Basketball Competition -->

    <b style = "font-size:30px">Designing a Gameplan for the Golden State Warriors</b> <br>
    As part of the executive board of the sports analytics club at Villanova, I helped lead a team in designing 
    <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/17fEVV0RaFbizc98_aBXm5AhDykG-EgnH/preview">this presentation</a>
     that ultimately won the 2023 Syracuse Basketball Analytics competition. We were tasked with building a gameplan to 
    defend the Golden State Warriors using play-by-play and possession data. We analyzed team and player tendencies, usually 
    using points per possession as a measure of efficiency. We also modeled points over expectation using an XGBoost model to
    identify areas of the court where the Warriors outperformed the average. I was in charge of the model building along with 
    a portion of the visualizations, and the team gave the presentation to a panel of judges who deemed ours the best ahead of finalists
    from Tulane, Penn, and Duke.

  <!--   ATP Confounding All-Stars -->

    <b style = "font-size:30px">The Most Confusing Players in Tennis</b> <br>
    I was inspired to write this article by a podcast episode trying to identify the players that are the hardest to
    analyze on the ATP tour. My approach to this question was to try and identify the least consistent players on tour since
    those would seem to me like the hardest to analyze. My first strategy for doing this was to look at match-to-match variance
    in player statistics. I also built a couple of models predicting match statistics using lagged player statistics to see which
    players were consistently the hardest to predict. All results and further discussion can be found in the article 
     <a href = "https://medium.com/@noahswan19/atp-confounding-all-stars-ba5ce15f4e5a">here</a> and the code for the article can be
    found

    padding:1em">
    <b style = "font-size:30px">Modeling Expected Points in Python</b> <br>
    I have mainly worked in R up until recently, and this is my first project doing data work in Python outside of some 
    spot work in my Deep Learning class. As an R programmer, you will notice most of the code 
    (<a href = "https://github.com/noahswan19/Misc-Projects/blob/main/Clean%20EP%20Model%20(2024.03.29%20NS).ipynb">here</a>) 
    takes advantage of method chaining in pandas at least for the data cleaning.
    For the project, I built an XGBoost model to predict the points scored on a drive
    given the circumstances in a play. This methodology underlies the EPA statistic oft-cited in NFL analytics circles. I compare
    my results to those included in the play-by-play data in the nfl_data_py python package.
