  <h2 align = "center">Shiny Apps</h2>
  <p style = "font-size:20px;padding-left: 45px;
  padding-right: 45px;">
    During my role as lead data scientist at Oklahoma City Energy, I built out several shiny apps for the coaching staff which I 
  wanted to share here. Apologies for any delays in accessing the apps; my code has improved since writing these apps initially but 
  they remain a relic of a couple of years ago. Despite some inefficiencies, I think the following apps have some interesting visuals.
    <ul style = "font-size:20px;padding-left: 65px;
  padding-right: 65px;">
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassMaps/">Pass Maps and xT</a> - This was the main app
      we used while I was working there with a variety of different graphs and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/PassNetworksApp/">Pass Networks</a> - This app hosted one 
      graphic that was computationally intensive (for my code at the time) to create and was offloaded to a separate app.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://noahswan19.shinyapps.io/Recruitment/">Recruitment App</a> - This was the main recruitment app that included visualizations
      related to the relative performances of players across different positions and statistics.</li>
      <li><a href = "https://nswan.shinyapps.io/KPI_App/">KPIs</a> - This app provided a more concise visual to track how the team performed
      across different statistics over the course of the season.</li>
    </ul>

        Predicting EPA for Professional Football</a>
        For my Deep Learning class, I worked with two classmates to build a model to predict EPA for NFL plays from the 2018 season.
        We compared results for a random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network architecture with the last of the three performing the best.
