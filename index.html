          <h3>Marginal Effect of XGBoost Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
          <p> In this article, I explore the trade-offs between wide and narrow hyperparameter search spaces when tuning XGBoost models. Alongside running systematic experiments, I provide an accessible breakdown of Tree-Structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), reviewing both the underlying research and the source code implementation in hyperopt. To support the analysis, I built a modular python codebase, using polars to structure data through a custom data class and designing reusable components for experimentation so that the methodology could be extended to different prediction tasks.</p>

          <h3>Simulating Tennis Matches</h3>
          <p>In this project, I developed and evaluated a method for predicting tennis match results using match simulation. This project brings together some different things I've worked on in the past along with my first attempt at simulation using maximum likelihood estimation. In order to predict matches, the method uses a post-match win probability model to estimate win probability for simulations of tennis matches drawn from match statistic distributions for each individual player. Further details on the implementation and methodology can be found in the article here and the code is posted on my GitHub.</p>

          <h3>Predicting Pass Play Results for Professional Football</h3>
          <p>For a Deep Learning class, I worked with two classmates to build a model to predict EPA and yards gained for NFL plays from the 2018 season. We wanted to see if we could build a model to predict the result of a pass play from conditions up to the throw. This model would allow us to attribute credit to quarterbacks or wide receivers who consistently achieve higher EPA after the throw when compared to the model's predictions. We compared results for a random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network architecture, with the last performing the best. The full report can be found here.</p>

          <p>As part of a Data Mining class, I worked with two classmates on a semester-long project to find a dataset and build a model. Our group attempted to build a model classifying whether a ball hit into a play resulted in a hit or an out using data from the 2021 MLB season. We compared several types of models in the analysis and also implemented the SMOTE method for dealing with a class imbalance. The full details can be found in our final report here.</p>

          <p>During my senior year, I completed a year-long thesis on uncertainty within macroeconomics (final product here). Inspired by different papers applying the work of Thomas Kuhn to the field of economics, I attempted to contextualize the development of uncertainty within a Kuhnian, paradigmatic framework. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to pursue independent research on a topic of interest.</p>

          <h3>Designing a Gameplan for the Golden State Warriors</h3>
          <p>As part of the executive board of the Sports Analytics Club at Villanova University, I helped lead a team in designing this presentation that ultimately won the 2023 Syracuse Basketball Analytics competition. We were tasked with building a gameplan to defend the Golden State Warriors using play-by-play and possession data. We analyzed team and player tendencies, using points per possession as a measure of efficiency. We also modeled points over expectation using an XGBoost model to identify areas of the court where the Warriors outperformed the average. I was in charge of the model building along with the visualizations, and the team gave the presentation to a panel of judges who deemed ours the best ahead of finalists from Tulane, Penn, and Duke.</p>

          <h3>"The Most Confusing Players in Tennis"</h3>
          <p>I was inspired to write this article after listening to a podcast episode trying to identify the hardest players to analyze on the ATP tour. My approach to this question was to try and identify the least consistent players on tour as a proxy for being difficult to analyze. My initial strategy was to look at match-to-match variance in player statistics. I also built a couple of models predicting match statistics using lagged player statistics to see which players were consistently the hardest to predict. All results and further discussion can be found in the article here and the code for the article can be found here.</p>

          <p>I have mainly worked in R up until recently, so this is my first project doing data work in Python outside of some spot work in a Deep Learning class. As an R programmer, you will notice most of the code here takes advantage of method chaining in pandas at least for the data cleaning. For the project, I built an XGBoost model to predict the points scored on a drive given the circumstances in a play. This methodology underlies the EPA statistic oft-cited in NFL analytics circles. I compare my results to those included in the play-by-play data in the nfl_data_py python package.</p>
